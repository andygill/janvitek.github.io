I want to give a shout-out to the excellent food served at TIFR, too!  Waaaaay better than any vegetarian food option at any of the previous tens of conferences I've attended.","Bus transportation was probably the weakest link.  There was some serious disorganization in helping folks find their buses leaving to different hotels (plenty of very avoidable missed-bus situations).  The late hour getting home after the banquet was also a serious pain factor, in terms of how rested I felt the next day.  The bus schedule on the post-conference workshop days seems to have gone too far in the other direction, overestimating travel time by at least an hour and forcing us to get up early for no pay-off.    Perhaps this level of uncertainty is unavoidable in India, which may have been a reason to think harder about whether it's a suitable location (though I'm not at all convinced that Mumbai was a bad idea... *shrug*).

I also miss the opportunity to chat with more of the usual suspects who go to POPL a majority of years, as I think most decided to skip this one because of complexities in travel, visas, etc.  SIGPLAN might consider requiring that a host country meet some kind of semi-objective standard in quality of bureaucracy to apply for needed travel permissions.

* PLMW is an excellent initiative - I was very pleased to talk with a woman persuaded to do a CS PhD by participation at PLMW'13. ","* It's hard to absorb the large number of technical talks, and I get most out of discussion with the authors. I wonder whether there's something that could be done to make POPL talks support more discussion? Some kind of 'meet the authors' thing attached to each talk session? Uncertain, but this year I skipped a lot of talks and got a lot more out of POPL.

* Some sessions were scheduled poorly, eg. Concurrency vs Program Analysis. I accept this is a hard problem, but it's a shame to have to miss interesting sessions. 

* It seems unfortunate that people leave immediately after the final session - little opportunity to chat with the presenters from the final session.
