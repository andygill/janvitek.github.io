    <richText>There is one for you and one for me.&#xD;&#xD;I was really happy to see that you did good on the exercise based on the book. Everyone did it really well. We will have more of those and, they may be longer but always bounded to 60 minutes.&#xD;&#xD;I also was able to access the result of the midsemester evaluation of the class. It seems that the part that needs most work is the assignments: one of you expressed the desire for &#x201C;Stricter deadlines for homeworks&#x201D;. I will see what can be done. Thanks for filling those in. (If anyone has more comments ... use the Add comment link, I will be happy to hear more)&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
