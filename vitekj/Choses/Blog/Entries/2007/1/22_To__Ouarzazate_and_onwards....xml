    <richText>&#xD;Fresh from our adventures in the Souk in Marrakech and loaded with carpets, we went on and crossed the Tizi-n-Ticka pass. There is snow there, actually you can ski not far from here. We were surprised to see many children walking to their school on the side of the road for many miles. Their little backpacks on their backs, they looked just like Nadia and Anton.&#xD;We stopped at the Ait Ben Abdou Casbah, an old fortified town that is now a UNESCO historical site. There was a small river protecting it -- the whole family took a little donkey ride to cross it.&#xD;Then we made it to Ouarzazate. This small town is the Moroccan Hollywood as it is the place where Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Babel and many other movies were filmed. They also shot some Jean-Claude Van Damme movies, but we forgive them, they did not know better.&#xD;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#xD;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;The pictures are [&lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/3F612959-C018-490A-ABF4-54C3EA40A4B5"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;].</richText>
