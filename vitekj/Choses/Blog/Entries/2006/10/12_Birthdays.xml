    <richText>We celebrated several birthdays in a row. Jan&#x2019;s birthday was taken care of with minimal pomp, a modest affair for an event to be mourned. Jan got a new TV (a 42&#x201D; Samsung DLP, not bad). Nadia&#x2019;s birthday was more festive with 7 little girls and 3 boys running around the house. The weather was warm and pleasant. Everyone had a good time. Olga&#x2019;s birthday was an occasion for us to spend an evening at work. (And she is getting the entire DVD collection of Sex and The City).&#xD;&#xD;Pictures are &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/1C5820D9-4EF8-48D2-8593-B086B1C31093"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;&#xD;Big news: Olga is a Swiss citizen now!  Only eight years of procedure -- we still need to go to Chicago for a passport. But this is really great.&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
