    	  <p>September 2009: A bug-fix release after bug-hunting during
          hundreds of hours of benchmarking for RTSS and JTRES papers. Ovm
    	  includes a configurable RTGC framework (Minuteman), which allows
          selection from different RTGC features: time-based scheduling
    	  (slack vs. periodic vs. hybrid which combines the two),
    	  incrementality, Brooks or replication style defragmentation,
    	  incremental object copy for replication. 

	  <li>
    	  <p>May 2009: In addition to periodic time-based scheduling, Ovm
    	  also supports slack-based scheduling, allowing to compare the
    	  performance and robustness of the two. Ovm now can run most of the
    	  Dacapo benchmarks. 		
    	  <li>
	  <p>April 2009: Support for arraylets.
 	  <li>
	  <p>October 2009: Ovm's RTGC supports incremental stack scanning and dynamic defragmentation.
	  <li>
          <p>August 2008: Core parts of Ovm are ported to RTEMS real-time operating system.
          It runs on RTEMS/LEON3 and RTEMS/x86. 
          <li>
          <p>June 2008: Ovm supports low-level direct access to hardware registers
          using hardware objects and allows to write hardware interrupt
          handlers, both under Linux/Xenomai/x86.
          <li>
          <p>May 2008: Ovm supports native scheduling using Pthreads.
          <li>
          <p>March 2008: Ovm runs the SPEC JBB benchmark.
          <li>
          <p>April 2008: Ovm's Java to C translator now supports plain C in
          addition to C++. A simple C implementation of Java exceptions
          allows GCC to generate faster code compared to C++ exceptions.  
          <li> 
          <p>February 2005: Ovm now under a BSD licence.
          <li>

                  primary use of the ScanEagle vehicle is to loiter over trouble
