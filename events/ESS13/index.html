          <p>Current production VMs are designed to target one main
            language. While they can execute other languages, these are
            often second-class citizens and their execution performance
            lags. We present Truffle, a system that allows multiple
            languages to efficiently execute on top of the Java HotSpot
            VM. The effort to add new languages is low as it requires
            only implementing an AST interpreter.</p>
          <p> We use the Graal compiler to automatically derive compiled
            code from the interpreter definitions via partial
            evaluation. We will show how to add a new guest language and
            how researchers can experiment with our platform.</p>
          <p> The Truffle API is publicly available as part of the Graal
            OpenJDK project. </p>

          <p>July 4th, 16:15 </p>
          <p>Personal computing has been radically changed by
            smartphones and tablets. Within a few years, these new
            devices have become as numerous as personal computers. They
            have also almost bridged the performance gap. A modern
            smartphone is equipped with a hardware that can compete the
            traditional laptop on many aspects. </p>
          <p>Since we permanently carry our phones with us. Since they
            are always connected to a network and since they are
            equipped with a vast set of sensors, they allow us to
            implement new applications that were inconceivable a few
            years back in the past: the diffuse applications. </p>
          <p>However, programming diffuse applications is difficult
            because it combines all the hardest points of the
            traditional programming to which it brings new problems of
            its own. In this course, we will present a new programming
            language called Hop, specially designed for addressing these
            problems. We will present the language, its constructs, its
            semantics, and how to program realistic diffuse
            applications. </p>

          <p>July 4th, 14:15</p>
          <p>Domain-specific languages are routinely used every day for
            purposes such as querying databases, typesetting documents
            and describing web page contents. Embedding a DSL is often
            idiomatic to many modern programming languages. Several
            language workbenches permit to develop a custom DSL from the
            ground up, but developing a DSL is often, for the largest
            part, a matter of rearranging the same old concepts in a
            different way.</p>
          <p> We show how to develop extensible DSLs using Neverlang, a
            JVM-based framework for language development that emphazises
            code reuse through composition of language features. We show
            how to implement each feature in a stand-alone module; that
            is, a separate, conceptually isolated and independent unit
            that can be compiled and distributed separately.</p>
          <p> We demonstrate how Neverlang can be employed to generate
            compilers andinterpreters that can be extended or restricted
            at any time, without any further compilation steps. </p>

          <p> The Smart Programming Assistant (SPA) analyzes and
            suggests repairs to your program while you are typing it.
            SPA tries to prove your program error-free with respect to a
            specification (Code Contracts), and if SPA finds errors in
            your program, it suggests a verified code repair. SPA
            simplifies correct program development via enhanced
            IntelliSense and via semantic refactoring, inferring general
            yet precise contracts for the extracted method. It enables
            code review by answering deep semantic queries. For example,
            "If x is null and y is &gt; 0, what happens to z at this
            other program point?" or "In the new version of your program
            you are making a stronger assumption on the environment.".
            The Smart Programming Assistant is built on the top of Code
            Contracts, which provided a uniform and standard API to
            specify contracts in .NET (since v4) and tools that consume
            contracts for documentation generation, dynamic, and static
            analysis. This project is joint work with M. Barnett, M.
            Fahndrich, S. Lahiri, T. Ball, and many smart interns and
            visiting researchers.</p>

            <h2>Analyzing JavaScript and the Web with WALA</h2>
          </a> <br>
          <h3>Julian Dolby and Max Schaefer</h3>
          <p>July 3rd, 14:15</p>
          <p>We will present the Watson Libraries for Analysis (WALA)
            from the perspective of analyzing Web applications,
            particularly the client side of such applications, i.e. Web
            pages and associated JavaScript code. As Web applications
            become more sophisticated on the client side, such analysis
            becomes more and more important. It also poses particular
            challenges, as the dynamic nature of JavaScript is
            exacerbated by rich frameworks that make heavy use of
            JavaScript's dynamic features to engage in metaprogramming.
            Specifically, we focus on:</p>
          <p> 1) The HTML front end that takes Web pages and composes a
            JavaScript program to analyze. We explain how to model the
            DOM objects, how to support recording very precise source
            mappings for JavaScript code, and how different HTML parsers
            can be integrated into WALA.</p>
          <p> 2) Code specialization in the front end. As purely static
            analysis of JavaScript often proves challenging due to the
            extreme dynamism in the language, we have experimented with
            techniques that allow specialization of code during IR
            generation. The mechanism permits arbitrary rewriting of
            ASTs and multiple different translation for the same method
            in different contexts.</p>
          <p> 3) IR specializations for JavaScript. We will discuss ways
            in which the WALA IR has been specialized to address aspects
            of JavaScript. We will describe the representation of
            function calls in particular.</p>
          <p> 4) Targeted context sensitivity. We will present the
            support in WALA, such as cartesian product algorithm context
            sensitivity, allowing analyses to tailor sensitivity to
            particular functions, object and construct. </p>

            <h2>R: A language for Analyzing Data</h2>
          </a>

          <p>
            The R language and runtime was released in 1995 and quickly
            gained its popularity as a tool for scientific computing.
            Over the last decade it has become a key platform for
            implementing data analysis algorithms. Today R has over 5000
            open-source packages, an estimated base of 2000 package
            developers and 2 million end users.
            For computer scientists, R is a useful tool for analyzing
            and visualizing
            experimental results. But most of all it
            is a challenge for researchers in programming languages and
            virtual
            machines. R has
            function closures with lexical scoping, but also lazy
            evaluation of function
            arguments through which one gets read/write access to caller
            scope. R allows to reflectively access code as text and to
            turn text into code and evaluate it in any scope. R code can
            run in synthetically created scopes, e.g. in data sets. R
            has rich support for vector arithmetics, including
            arithmetics with missing data. The FastR project aims to
            provide a faster implementation of R. FastR is implemented
            in Java and currently can run simple benchmarks with
            speedups usually about 3x but up to 20x.

          <p>This tutorial is an introduction to developing domain
            specific languages (DSLs) for productivity and performance
            using Scala, LMS and Delite. Lightweight Modular Staging
            (LMS) is a pragmatic approach to runtime code generation in
            Scala and Delite is a compiler framework for embedded DSLs
            &nbsp;that simplifies the process of implementing DSLs for
            parallel computation and heterogeneous targets.</p>
          <p> This tutorial provides an overview of the technology
            stack, presents existing high-performance DSL built using
            the framework, and guides the attendees through the process
            of creating DSLs.</p>
