The S3 Lab was created in 1999 to foster systems                    and programming language research. It is run jointly by Patrick                    Eugster, Tony Hosking, Suresh Jagannathan, and Jan Vitek.                    We investigate the application of static and dynamic program                    analyses to object-oriented, functional, and real-time programs                    for the purposes of optimization and validation of correctness                    and security properties. We also develop open source software                    in the areas of mobile and untrusted computation, embedded                    systems, concurrent and distributed systems, and persistent                    programming. Our active research directions include software                    transactions, intrusion detection, ownership types, real-time                    Java, aspect-oriented programming, semantics of concurrency                    control, and static program analysis.</font></p>                  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our work has current funding from the National                    Science Foundation, DARPA, IBM, Microsoft Research, Cisco,                    NEC, and Intel. The lab has close ties with industrial research                    labs at Motorola, Sun, IBM and Intel. We have a long history                    of placing students at those labs. We also collaborate with                    researchers across the US, Europe, and Asia.</font></p>                  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Applicants are expected to take part in                    the research and social life of the lab, interact with students                    and work closely with faculty. Presently, the lab has 12                    graduate students, two Post-docs, and several undergraduates.                    We expect to hire up to four new graduate students and two                    additional post-docs. For post-doctoral positions a PhD in                    Computer Science is required, for doctoral students research                    experience is desirable. Preference will be given to applicants                    with experience in one of the following areas:</font></p>                  <div align="justify">                    <ul>                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Runtime Systems and Virtual Machines </font></li>                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Programming Language Implementation </font></li>                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Program Analysis and Formal Verification </font></li>                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Type                          Systems & Language                      Semantics </font></li>                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Real-time and Embedded Systems                        </font>                        <p></p>                      </li>                    </ul>                  </div>                  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Applicants should send a CV, a statement                    of research interests, and the name of three references who                    may be contacted for letters of recommendation.
