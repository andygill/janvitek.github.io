<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>

        A mobile object system is a collection of objects that may  move from
        one execution environment to another, which may be located on another 
        machine with a different hardware and software platform, resuming their 
        computation in this new context. 
        <P>
        This workshop deals with design and implementation issues of 
        programming languages and systems for mobile objects. 

<H3>TOPIC</H3>

        The recent interest in software agents --software entities operating on  
        behalf of some user over a large-scale and heterogeneous network-- has 
        been a driving factor for the  development of a number of new languages 
        and systems, with the most widely publicized  effort being the 
        Telescript language (General Magic), but some degree of agent support 
        is present in languages such as Tycoon (Uni Hamburg), Phantom (Trinity 
        College), Safe-Tcl, M0 (University of Geneva), Facile (ECRC), Joule 
        (Agorics), Object REXX (IBM), Obliq (Digital) and  Java (SUN), and in 
        system such as MOLE (IVPR, Stuttgart), Ara (Uni Kaiserslautern), Tcl 
        Agents (Dartmouth) and Map (IMAG Grenoble). <BR>
        The common characteristic of all of these projects is their emphasis on 
        mobile computation and remote programming. <P>
        
        The goal of this workshop is to investigate the requirements of mobile 
        object systems, evaluate how current languages respond to these 
        requirements and chart new research directions.<P>

        Mobile object systems address distributed programming from a different 
        angle than remote procedure call (RPC) based distributed systems. Where 
        RPC based systems rely on high-level interfaces to communicate passive 
        data between remote sites, mobile object systems offer a flexible lower 
        level interface for the exchange of active programs. Mobile object 
        system are geared towards distributed computation in very-large, 
        distributed and heterogeneous computer systems where security and
        performance are key concerns.<P>

        This workshop will be a forum for discussing implementation and design 
        issues. A non-exhaustive list of topics include: <P>
<UL>
            <LI> Semantics of mobile object systems
            <LI> Linguistic support for mobility
            <LI> Portable intermediate representations
            <LI> Dynamic compilation vs. interpretation
            <LI> Static analysis of mobile object systems
            <LI> Resource management
            <LI> Code distribution and versioning schemes
            <LI> Security considerations
            <LI> Experience reports
</UL>
<H3>AUDIENCE</H3>

        This workshop brings together researchers working on object-oriented 
        languages and systems that support mobile computation. <BR>          
        The emphasis of the workshop will be on language and system implementation  issues rather  than on applications  of  the  mobile   object 
        technology. <BR>
        Workshop attendees  are expected to take an active part in the discussions.  A position  paper will be written  to summarize the results of 
        the workshop.<P>


<H3>HOW TO APPLY</H3>

        Prospective participants should submit a position paper  describing 
        current research in the field (&lt;=10 pages) AND a problem statement
        outlining a particular problem to discuss at the workshop (1-2 pages).
        Both should be submitted via e-mail to:<BR>
<CENTER>                        ecoopws@cui.unige.ch</CENTER>
        Submissions should survey technology, or describe original research, 
        design and development, and/or implementation. Results should be clear 
        and useful to other practitioners in  the field. Description of a new 
        system should include reproducible, useful results or lessons learned. 
        Every paper will get at least three reviews. Final papers will follow 
        the Springer Verlag  LNCS format:<BR>
<CENTER>      (gopher://trick.ntp.springer.de/11/tex/latex/llncs).</CENTER>
        Submitted URL's of papers and/or of home pages will be included into 
        the WWW page of the workshop (URL see below). A selection of the best
        papers will be considered for publication by Springer-Verlag.<P>

<H3>FORMAT</H3>

        The workshop will take place in the two days before the conference.
        The first day of the workshop will be devoted to presentations of 
        on-going work and of state of the art systems. Discussions of the 
        problem topics submitted by the participants will take place on the 
        second day.<P>
