<h2>
Terse (and technical) definitions of the term ``Mobile Agent''
</h2>

Collected at the 2nd International Workshop on Mobile Object
Systems ("Agents on the Move"), ECOOP96 Conference, July 1996.

 <li> Kazuhiko Kato/University of Tsukuba<br>
<em>Mobile agents are objects consisting of code, data and execution state
that may go beyond protections domains.</em><br><br>

 <li> Gian Pietro Picco/Politecnico di Torino, and
      Giovanni Vigna/Politecnico di Milano<br>
<em>A mobile agent is a component containing at least one thread of
execution, which is able to autonomously migrate to a different site.  A
site is a component execution environment inside which inter-component
communication is less expensive than communication among components
residing on different sites.</em><br><br>

 <li> Christian Tschudin/University of Zurich<br>
<em>A mobile agent is a thread of control which can trigger the transfer of
arbitrary code to a remote computer such that: (i) this code has a chance
to be executed remotely and independently, (ii) the resulting remote
thread may trigger another code transfer.</em><br><br>

 <li> Jan Vitek/University of Geneva<br>
<em>A mobile agent is a set of objects performing a computation on behalf
of a user. This computation is performed within an agent execution
platform which controls the execution of the agent. An agent may
request to be moved causing its computation to be interrupted and
resumed on another platform.</em><br><br>

<em>A mobile agent is a program: (i) that a person or organization vests with
its authority, (ii) that can run unattended for a long time (e.g., a week),
(iii) that can meet and interact with other agents (iv) and that can execute
on different computer systems at different times of its life.</em><br><br>

 <li> Anonymous (in "Aufruf zur Teilnahme am 2. Deutschen Mobile-Agenten-Treffen",
      July 1996)<br>
<em>Mobile agents are programs that - together with their data resources - can
move in a computer network from host to host in order to go after their task.</em><br><br>
