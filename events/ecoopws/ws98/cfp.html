mobile object systems, mobile code, programming languages, mobile agents,
java. </I></P>

<P>Applications executing over the Internet are currently of major interest
to academe and industry. Mobility of code, and of running computations
and objects, is widely regarded as an attractive paradigm for programming
these applications. Yet, in order for the mobile object technology to be
more widely accepted, innovative security solutions that provide solid
security guarantees to clients and service providers have to be developed.
</P>

<P>The 4th Workshop in the ECOOP series on Mobile Object Systems aims to
bring together mobile object system and language designers, security experts,
and generally people interested in discussing the current state and future
direction of security research in the mobile object system context. The
workshop will be a forum to learn about the latest research, and also to
discuss and exchange ideas concerning on-going theoretical and implementation
work. </P>

<P>It is our goal to bring you together with people from different research
and development communities working towards the same goal as you! </P>

<P>The workshop will be held on the 21th of July 1998, just prior to the
ECOOP'98 conference taking place in Brussels, Belgium. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Topics covered</FONT></B></P>

<P>This year's workshop focuses on the security aspects of mobile computations.
The list of topics includes, but is not limited to, the following: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Theoretical foundations of secure mobile computations,</LI>

<LI>Mobile object code verification techniques,</LI>

<LI>Security policy modeling for mobile object systems,</LI>

<LI>Security protocols for agent authentication,</LI>

<LI>Integrity and availability issues in mobile object systems,</LI>

<LI>Secure language and system implementation techniques,</LI>

<LI>Java security issues relevant to mobility and mobile code,</LI>

<LI>Mobility related experience reports and horror stories,</LI>

<LI>Secure mobile object system applications. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The workshop is being organized as part of a &quot;double bill&quot;
with the ECOOP workshop on Distributed Object Security. Thus, authors wishing
to submit papers on general security issues are invited to submit that
workshop; its call for papers can be found <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A HREF="http://sirac.inrialpes.fr/~jensen/ewdos.html">http://sirac.inrialpes.fr/~jensen/ewdos.html</a></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Submission of papers</FONT></B></P>

<P>Both full papers (maximum 15 pages) and position papers (1 page) are
welcome. Authors wishing to submit a paper should send the paper in postscript
form to the e-mail address <I>ecoopws@cui.unige.ch</I> by April 13, 1998.
Along with the submitted paper, authors are requested to send a brief biography,
6 to 7 lines maximum, which should include a description of their current
research activities. </P>

<P>We encourage not only submissions presenting original research results,
but also papers that attempt to establish links between different approaches
to mobile object system development, and/or papers that include survey
material. Original research results should be clearly described, and their
usefulness to practitioners outlined. </P>

<P>The best full papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.</P>

<P>Furthermore, in view of the cooperation with the ECOOP workshop on distributed
object security, papers received that seem better suited for that workshop
will be forwarded to its organizers. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Workshop format</FONT></B></P>

<P>Paper selection will be based on the quality of the submitted material.
The number of participants will be limited, and attendance will be by invitation
only. Authors whose papers are accepted will be invited to give a presentation.
</P>

<P>An e-mail forum will be set up before the workshop to foster exchange
and prepare for the discussion topics. </P>
