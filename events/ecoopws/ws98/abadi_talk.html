<H3>Abstract</H3>
<P>
  We discuss abstractions for protection and the correctness of their
  implementations. Relying on the concept of full abstraction, we
  consider several examples relevant to mobile object systems. The main
  example is the translation of Java classes to an intermediate bytecode
  language. Other examples are the implementation of procedures by
  closures and the implementation of private communication channels in
  terms of cryptographic operations.
<P>
  (This talk is an adapted and abridged version of one to be given at
  ICALP 98; a paper on this material will appear in the proceedings of
  that conference.)
