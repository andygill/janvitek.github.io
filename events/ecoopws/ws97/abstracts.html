<h3>Efficient Code Migration for Modular Mobile Agents
(<a href="papers/hohl.ps.gz">ps.gz</a>)</h3>

The efficiency of object migration is a very important aspect of mobile
object systems.  Since an object consists of at least data and code, and
since the transport of data cannot be optimized except by using standard
compression techniques, the migration of code is the most important part
of the efficiency aspect.  This paper examines therefore the question of
how to design a code migrating component in an efficient manner.  The
main focus of this examination lies on mobile agent systems, a special
case of mobile object systems.<br>
  Therefore, after listing the requirements of code migration in this
area, and a description of the code migration mechanisms of the Java
applet model, a more appropriate approach is proposed.  This new
approach uses two mechanisms to transport code: one, that is able to get
classes in an efficient manner and one, that is able to get any valid
class by its reference.  Both mechanisms uses a transport protocol that
is both able to interface to local and remote agent runtime environments
and a code replacement policy, that is able to handle a space restricted
class storage.  Finally the approach uses digital signatures to protect
the code migration component, the codeserver, against modification
attacks.<p>

<h3>Mobile Agents in Active Networks
(<a href="papers/huber.ps.gz">ps.gz</a>)</h3>

Active networking introduces a new flexible network service paradigm. 
The passive data carrier is changed to an active, dynamically
configurable, data-transport-service machine, through the possibility of
performing computation in the network nodes.  Utilization of mobile
agents allows to deliver service tasks to any place in the network.  An
agent can execute adaptive filtering on the bypassing data streams, do
user intended signalling and handle network management tasks in a
distributed manner.<br>
Looking at the aspects of network services, benefits arise from the fact
that the transmission protocols can be tailored to the application by
providing filtering or format conversion within the network.  The "one
fits all" approach, like TCP/UDP which can just handle end-to-end loss
control are strongly improved.<br>
Generally speaking there are two ways in providing active services in
the network: the full user based approach, allowing the end user to
distribute its own, application dependent stream forwarding agent.  It
can be used in the open Internet where the mobile agents can provide
bridges over legacy systems.  Or, the layered approach, giving only the
administrator of the network the possibility to deploy new service
classes within the network.  This is particularly interesting in a
Intranet scenario, permitting to deploy new services rapidly and
granting the user  only  the execution of the new service.<br>
We are also concerned by service and system security and failure
protection aspects of this approach: When an agent becomes mobile and it
includes the possibility to reproduce child agents in any number, the
problems of agent flooding become apparent.  Therefore solutions have to
be proposed to guarantee, that the agents which get lost or out of
control, will time out and return to their home, or die immediately.  A
possible solution based on credits is presented and discussed.<br>
This paper reviews efforts in the research domain: including the Active
IP projects at MIT, the Active Networking project at Georgia Institute
of Technology and the NetScript approach from Columbia University.  Our
alternative approach is presented, which allows fast service deployment,
examples of service usage and a service and system security concept for
the proposed architecture.<p>

<h3>Using the Knowbot Operating Environment in a Wide-Area Network
(<a href="papers/hylton.ps.gz">ps.gz</a>)</h3>

Jeremy Hylton, Guido van Rossum<br>

For a number of years CNRI has been developing a system for supporting
mobile agents (Knowbot Programs) in a wide-area network.  Applications
can use the system to migrate computation among nodes in a distributed
system.  The result is an application that can optimize its
communication patterns to reduce bandwidth and latency and can adapt to
changes in network service.  The Knowbot Operating Environment includes
service stations that run mobile agents and reporting stations that
track their progress.  These components are integrated via a distributed
namespace.  We describe the overall architecture and discuss some
experience with the current implementation.  Experimental results from
an application that uses Knowbot Programs to monitor Web pages show that
mobile agents can outperform equivalent stationary programs.  The
experimenance benefits are obtained by moving clients within the network
to reduce the costs of wide-area network connections.<p>

<h3>Performance Issues in TACOMA
(<a href="papers/not_revised.ps.gz">ps.gz</a>)</h3>

Dag Johansen, Nils P. Sudmann, Robbert van Renesse<br>

Mobile code performance depends, in part, on the costs of
transferring an agent from one host to another and of initiating execution
of that agent on a target host. These costs are reported for TACOMA
(Tromso and COrnell Moving Agents) v1.3, a UNIX-based system that
supports agents. The experiments suggest opportunities for performance
enhancements, both by changing the underlying operating system and
by changing the architecture of the TACOMA run-time system.<p>

<h3>System Support for Mobile Agents
(<a href="papers/karnik.ps.gz">ps.gz</a>)</h3>

Neeran M. Karnik, Anand R. Tripathi<br>
<tt>karnik@cs.umn.edu</tt><p>

Mobile objects can be used as a basis for supporting the mobile agents
paradigm, which provides an interesting new approach for network-centric
programming. We examine the language-level features needed for such
applications, and describe a Java object-based mobile agent architecture
that can provide system-level support for those features. Security is
usually a major concern with mobile agent systems. We discuss security
related issues such as authentication of mobile agents, protection of
resources and privacy of communications, in the context of our
architecture.<p>

<h3>Old Wine in New Bottles Applying OS Process Migration Technology to
Mobile Agents
(<a href="papers/wheeler.ps.gz">ps.gz</a>)</h3>

Dejan S. Milojicic, Shai Guday, Richard Wheeler<br>
<tt>{d.milojicic|s.guday|r.wheeler}@opengroup.org</tt><p>

We describe how our experience with classic operating system level
process migration mechanisms influenced the design of MOA, a mobile
agents project.  A case is presented for implementing mobile agents
using language environments and overcoming the limitations of those
environments by employing mechanisms adapted from classic process
migration implementations.<p>

<h3>Travelling Objects, a New Paradigm in Distributed Object Computing
(<a href="papers/neudeck.ps.gz">ps.gz</a>)</h3>

The massive growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web caused a shift
in thinking about development and distribution of software. The global
sharing of information, the operation on multiple platforms in
heterogeneous networks, and the lucrative signs of electronic commerce
force application developers to make their applications work in a
distributed client-server environment, dealing with incompatible
hardware architectures and operating systems.<br>

This paper introduces Travelling Objects (TOs), a new paradigm in
distributed object computing, based on an enhanced object model and
built upon the platform-independent and dynamic programming language
Java. Additionally, the authors provide an insight how the Travelling
Object Runtime System (TORS) allows to send, receive, and interact with
TOs. Finally, an easy-to-use TO Generator is introduced that produces
TOs out of arbitrary Java applications.<p>

<h3>On Stacks and Russian Dolls: Mobile Objects in Configurable
Communication Protocols
(<a href="papers/pereira.ps.gz">ps.gz</a>)</h3>

Jose Orlando Pereira, Rui Oliveira<br>
<tt>{jop|rco}@di.uminho.pt</tt><p>

This paper introduces Groupz, a novel group communication protocol
development framework. It merges advantages of traditional communication
protocol support environments with object mobility, proposing multiple
nested mobile objects as the natural evolution of layered protocols. By
shifting the focus of protocol development from data messages to mobile
objects, it makes possible to build configurable and adaptable system
software, suited for problematic environments such as world-wide
networks, without overlooking efficiency.<p>

<h3>Using mobility to make transparent distribution practical
(<a href="papers/not_revised.ps.gz">ps.gz</a>)</h3>

Some of the most diffcult questions to answer when designing a
distributed application are related to mobility: what information to
transfer between sites and when and how to transfer it. Transparent
distribution, the property that a program's behavior is independent of
how it is partitioned among sites, does not directly address these
questions. Therefore we propose to extend the language semantics with
mobility control. the ability for objects to migrate between sites or to
remain stationary at one site. In this way, the syntax and semantics of
objects are the same regardless of whether they are used as stationary
servers, mobile agents, or simply as caches. We show how to give objects
an arbitrary mobility behavior that is independent of the object's
definition. This gives the programmer a simple and effective control both
over information transfer and over the resulting network communication
patterns. These ideas have been implemented in Distributed Oz, a
concurrent object-oriented language which is state-aware and has dataflow
synchronization. Distributed Oz is an extension to the
publicly*-available Oz 2.0 system.<p>

<h3>Using Mobile Code to Control Native Execution of Distributed UNIX
(<a href="papers/tschudin.ps.gz">ps.gz</a>)</h3>

<tt>tschudin@icsi.berkeley.edu, {muhugusa|neuschwa}@cui.unige.ch</tt><p>

This paper presents MOS, a hybrid mobile/native code architecture where
interpreted mobile code (messengers expressed in the M0 language) is
used to control the execution of native code.  This results in the
mobile code interpreters becoming microkernels.  Interpreted messengers
are responsible for resource allocation in the network i.e., they are
the glue between remote nodes, while CPU intensive tasks are executed by
native code targeted at some specific hardware architecture. We describe
the MOS support for native code execution and an implementation done at
the University of Geneva where we demonstrated the native execution of a
UNIX process under interpreted mobile code control.<br>

<h3>Protecting Mobile Agents through Tracing
(<a href="papers/vigna.ps.gz">ps.gz</a>)</h3>

Giovanni Vigna<br>
<tt>vigna@elet.polimi.it</tt><p>

Mobile code systems provide a flexible and powerful platform
to build distributed applications in an Internet scale, but they rise strong
requirements from the security point of view. Security issues include au
thentication of the different remote parties involved and protection of the
execution environments from malicious agents. Nonetheless, the most
diffcult task is to protect roaming agents from execution environments.
This paper presents a new mechanism based on execution tracing and
cryptography that allows an agent owner to determine if some site in the
route followed by the agent tried to tamper with the agent state or code.<br>
