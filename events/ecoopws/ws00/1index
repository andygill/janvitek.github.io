<P>Code and program mobility has become a fundamental element of Internet 
programming, as seen from its use in application models such as active 
networking and network computing. The object-oriented community has been to the 
forefront of mobility, with technologies like Emerald through to Java. Despite 
this success, hard questions remain, notably with respect to security, efficient 
operating system support and mobile object application design and programming 
techniques.</P>

<P>The ECOOP Workshop On Mobile Object Systems was first held in 1995, and has been 
held every year since. Its goal has been to bring together researchers and 
practitioners working on mobility. 
Recent editions of the workshop have treated operating system 
support (1997), security (1998) and programming languages (1999). 
This year's workshop is broadened in scope to include all of these 
topics. Our primary aim is to foster discussion between researchers 
working in these three intrinsically linked areas. 
We are also interested in proposals that treat aspects of mobile 
objects that have received relatively little attention, e.g., 
operating system support for state capture mechanisms, resource control for 
security, and agent program development techniques.</P>

<P>The workshop will be held on June 12 or June 13 2000, in conjunction
with the ECOOP 2000 conference taking place in Cannes, France. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Submission of papers</FONT></B></P>

<P>Interested authors are invited to send position papers (of any
length) to ecoopws@cui.unige.ch <B>in postscript form</B>
by March 24. Papers will be accepted on the
basis of their ability to stimulate discussion during the workshop.
Accepted papers will be made available to the workshop's participants
at the workshop's web site well in advance of the workshop.</P>
