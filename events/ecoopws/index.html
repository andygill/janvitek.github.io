<h1>Mobile Object Systems: Homepage</h1>
The Mobile Object Systems Workshop series is held yearly in conjunction
with the European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP).
<p>
The MOS workshops deal with issues of mobility in object orientation: 
mobile objects, mobile code, and mobile agents. 
<p>
The workshop series has been quite successful, two  LNCS State-of-the-art Surveys
were published following MOS'96 and MOS'98, every short versions of accepted
papers have been included in ECOOP Reader volumes (Springer), and the
proceedings of MOS'98 are also available as a technical report form the INRIA.
