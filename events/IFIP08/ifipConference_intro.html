Since  then  it has met roughly every 9 to 12 months. There are many Working Groups  under   the aegis of IFIP (The International Federation for Information Processing).   Nine working groups in areas related to software  comprise IFIP Technical  Committee   2.</span></p><p><font color="#993366" size=4>The Group's Purpose</font><br>  <span class="paragraph">When originally created, the mandate of the group was   to investigate System Implementation Languages. Over time, the interests of   the group have evolved while the original focus now appears less important.   Consequently, the group decided at its Banff meeting, held in September 1999,   to change its name to</span></p><blockquote>  <p class="paragraph"><em>Software Implementation Technology</em>.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph">The more generic title includes, but is not limited to, the   following areas of concern:</p><ul>  <li><span class="paragraph">The relationship of language design to system construction,     maintenance and enhancement. </span></li>  <li><span class="paragraph">Software portability and reusability, and how they     can best be achieved using new techniques such as Java and XML. </span></li>  <li><span class="paragraph">Compilation techniques from analysis to code generation     and optimization. </span></li>  <li><span class="paragraph">Experience in the use of languages for building     system software. </span></li>  <li><span class="paragraph">Software and hardware environments to facilitate     the design, construction and maintenance of large software systems. </span></li>  <li><span class="paragraph">The influence of distributed technology, the internet     and parallelism on the design, maintenance and efficiency of system software.     </span></li>  <li><span class="paragraph">The particular focus of the group is upon the pragmatic     engineering aspects of the problem: measurements, evaluation, critical comparisons,     and development of economically viable techniques.</span><br>  </li></ul><p><font color="#993366" size=4>WG 2.4 Meetings</font><br>  <span class="paragraph">The working group meets about every 9 to 12 months,   normally alternating between venues in North America and Europe. Usually,  about   25 to 40 members and observers attend a meeting. The meetings are held in an   informal conference format: participants are asked to give presentations of    their actual work on topics within the scope of WG 2.4.<br>  <br>  Note: Attendance at meetings is by invitation only. If you are interested in   participating as an observer in a future meeting, you may make a request to   attend through your IFIP TC-2 national representative, or you may contact any   member of WG 2.4.</span></p></body></html>
