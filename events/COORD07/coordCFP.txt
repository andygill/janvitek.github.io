Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent,
distributed, real-time, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components.
New models, architectures, languages, and verification techniques are
necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of
today's software development.  COORDINATION aims to explore the
spectrum of languages, middleware, services, and algorithms that
separate behavior from interaction, therefore increasing modularity,
simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development.

Topics of interest:

-  PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE techniques that support orchestration and control
   of distributed and concurrent interaction.
-  MIDDLEWARE ARCHITECTURES: shared spaces, publish-subscribe, 
   event-based.
-  DYNAMIC SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURES: software composition and scripting
   languages, dynamic software evolution and update, configuration and
   deployment languages.
-  DEPENDABLE, RESOURCE-AWARE, REAL-TIME and EMBEDDED system coordination.
-  Models and Foundations: component composition, verification, management
   of security and dynamic aspects of coordination.
-  WEB SERVICES: Service-oriented Architectures, Workflow Systems.
-  Programming abstractions for decentralized distributed systems such as
   P2P, mobile ad-hoc and sensor networks.
-  TYPE SYSTEMS and SPECIFICATION LANGUAGES appropriate for coordination 
   of concurrent systems.
-  CASE STUDIES from E-Commerce, Factory Automation, Collaboration, 
   Command and Control, or other systems.

                           PROCEEDINGS

Proceedings of previous editions of this conference were published by
Springer, in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series and
are available as LNCS volumes 1061, 1282, 1594, 1906, 2315, 2949,
3454 and 4038. Our intention is to continue this series.

Selected papers from COORDINATION will be invited to a special issue
of The Science of Computer Programming journal.

A best student paper award will be given at the conference. To be eligible
for consideration indicate on your submission if one or more of the 
paper's authors are students.

                       SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Authors are invited to submit full papers electronically in PDF before 27
January 2007. Further instructions are available from the conference web 
site.

Submissions must be formatted according to the LNCS guidelines (see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html) and must not exceed 17 
pages  in length (including all supplementary material). Papers that are 
not in the requested format or exceed the mandated length will be rejected 
without going through the review process. Simultaneous or similar 
submissions to other conferences or journals are not allowed.
