<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Call for Papers</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The purpose of the 2nd Distributed Object
Security Workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of security problems
relating to distributed object-oriented systems. As object-oriented applications
are becoming omnipresent, the need for security has become a pressing issue.
The object-oriented paradigm offers basic abstractions such as interfaces
and data abstractions which have been used for security.&nbsp; Object-oriented
programming languages that include mechanisms such as strong-typing and
automatic memory management can be used as the foundations of new software-based
security architectures. But, for all of these advantages, object systems
must deal with issues such as the granularity of protection and dynamic
binding which blurs the line between trusted and untrusted components.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Distribution accentuates the existing problems.
In object-based systems such as CORBA and DCOM, objects are used to define
and structure communication protocols. In these systems issues such as
authenticity, integrity and privacy of messages must be addressed. In truly
distributed object-oriented systems, objects may be moved along with their
behavior. This brings in new security challenges as trusted and untrusted
code may be integrated in the same address space and allowed to interact
in intricate ways.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Reusability is one of the traditional virtues
of object-orientation. However, security problems may arise when objects
are reused in an execution context that is different from the context of
the original implementation, e.g., the authentication and authorization
required by an object modeling a bank account is very different, depending
on whether its methods are being invoked from within the banks database
or by a home-banking client on the Internet.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Component-based programming and Java Beans
allow large parts of applications to be assembled out of an existing collection
of components or beans. However, components and beans have the same potential
security problems as reusing ordinary objects. The problems arise because
components and beans cannot deal with the non-functional requirements,
such as security, of the application.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">New programming paradigms, such as reflection
and aspect-oriented programming, have been proposed to deal with non-functional
requirements. Although these paradigms look promising, they also introduce
new questions such as: How can we use these paradigms to program secure
applications? and how can we build secure systems that support these paradigms?</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Topics of interest include but are not
restricted to:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Application security requirements</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Security models for object-oriented languages</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Security in the CORBA or COM frameworks</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Security for mobile code</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Security policies</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Reflections and Aspect Oriented Programming</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Formal methods and verification</font></li>

<li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Protection and reuse</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Practical experiences</font></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Submissions of papers</font></h2>
<font face="Arial Black">Participation to the workshop is by invitation
only.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; All prospective participants
are expected to submit a position paper presenting their work (the position
paper should not exceed 6 pages) along with a "hot topic" that they wish to
discuss at the workshop.&nbsp; Submissions should be sent 
by electronic mail (standard PostScript or PDF) to</font>
<center>
<h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">dosws@cs.tcd.ie&nbsp; by&nbsp; September 17.</font></h4></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">All papers will be refereed.&nbsp; We encourage
not only submissions presenting original research results, but also papers
that attempt to establish links between different approaches to security
and/or papers that include survey material. Original research results should
be clearly described, and their usefulness to practitioners outlined.</font>
