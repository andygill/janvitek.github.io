Smith</a>, University of Wisconsin, <br>              <em>A Unified View of Virtualization</em>  <br /><br>	      <strong>Abstract</strong>              <p>Virtualization technologies have been developed by a numberof computer science and engineering disciplines, sometimesindependently, often by different groups and at differenttimes.  Not surprisingly, these groups each view virtualizationas a sub-discipline, so it is studied in a fragmented way.In the future, however, virtualization will become an essentialpart of all computer systems by providing smart interconnectionmechanisms for the three major system components -- applicationsoftware, system software, and hardware.  Consequently, thestudy of virtualization technologies will become a disciplinein its own right and will stand on equal footing with the othermajor areas of computer systems design.		</p>  	      <strong>Bio</strong>              <p>James  E. Smith is a professor in the Department of Electri-cal and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  He received his PhD in 1976 from the University ofIllinois.  Since then, he has been involved in a  number  ofcomputer research and development projects as a faculty mem-ber at Wisconsin and in industry (Control Data  Corporation,Astronautics  Coporation, Cray Research).  Currently, he andhis research group are studying the virtual machine abstrac-tion as a technique for providing high performance and powerefficiency through co-design and tight coupling  of  virtualmachine hardware and software.Prof.  Smith recieved the ACM/IEEE 1999 Eckert-Mauchly Awardfor contributions to the field of computer architecture.  Heis  co-author  with  Ravi Nair of a book on virtual machinessoon to be published by Morgan Kaufmann.		</p>  <br><br><hr><br><br>	<a name="nally">              <strong>Tuesday, Keynote Talk</strong></a> Martin Nally, IBM<br>               <em>Application Servers: Virtualizing Location, Resources, Memory, Users and		 Threads For Business Applications and Web Applications</em>  <br /><br>	      <strong>Abstract</strong>              <p> Application servers provide an environment forrunning business and web applications. By virtualizing threads, dataand processing resources, memory and users, they provide thesimplifying illusion for the programmer that the application isinteracting with a single user, is running alone on the server, and isthe sole user of resources, while allowing an efficient realizationthat scales with the number of users, and available hardware. Theyalso provide a virtual environment where security enforcement anddemarcation of transaction boundaries are automatic. This talk willdescribe some of the major features of modern application servers andshow how concepts of virtualization are fundamental to their designand realization.		</p>  	      <strong>Bio</strong>              <p>Martin Nally is an IBM Distinguished Engineer who joined IBM in 1990 with 10 years prior industry experience. He was the lead architect and developer for IBM VisualAge/Smalltalk, and lead architect and overall development manager for IBM WebSphere Studio. He has been designing tools for application server programming and designing application server programming model abstractions for over 10 years. His current titles are Chief Architect, Rational Desktop Tools, and co-chair of the IBM Software Group programming model workgroup.		</p>  </body></html>
