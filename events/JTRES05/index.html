Withboth Sun and IBM developing virtual machines that complies with theReal-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ), and many other vendors joining thereal-time Java ecosystem, the time is right to take Java to the world oflarge and distributed real-time systems.  This presentation will look atthe approach Raytheon took to introduce real-time Java to a large real-timeproject and share some of the lesson learned.			    </span> </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td>10:00</td>                <td><strong>Break</strong></td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td valign="top">10:20</td>                <td><p><span class="style6">Design and implementation of the Ovm RTSJ VM:  an                    experience report</span><br><em>                  Jason Baker, Krista Bennet, Antonio Cunei, Chapman Flack,                    Christian Grothoff, David Holmes, Andrey Madan, Gergana Markova,                    Jeremy Manson, Krzystof Palacz, Filip Pizlo, Marek Prochazka,                    Jacques Thomas, Hiroshi Yamauchi, Jan Vitek (Purdue University)</em><br>  					                <span class="style6">A Simulation Based Model Checker for                    Real Time Java</span> <br><em>Gary Lindstrom (University of                    Utah), Peter C.

Designing real-time and embedded              systems that implement their required capabilities, are dependable              and predictable, and are parsimonious in their use of limited computing              resources is hard; building them on time and within budget is even              harder. It is therefore essential that the production of real-time              embedded systems can take advantage of languages, tools, and methods              that enable higher software productivity. <br>               <br>               Ideally, developers should use a programming language that shields              them from many  complexities, such as type errors, memory              management and that allow them to express the desiredapplication structure in a convenient way -- such as supporting periodictasks or sporadic events in the language. The Java programming language has become an attractive              choice because of advantages such as safety, productivity, low              maintenance costs, and availability of well trained developers.              But, to meet real-time constraints, issues such as under-specification              of thread scheduling and predictability of the runtime system must              be addressed. A number of real-time extensions to Java have been              proposed, the main two being the Real-Time Specification              for Java (RTSJ) and the J-Consortium Real-Time Core Extension (RTCore).              The intent of these specifications is to ease the development of              real-time applications by providing several additions such as extending              the memory management model, providing stronger semantics in thread              scheduling, and so on. </p>             <br>             <div class="titlebar">::Goal::</div>             <p> There is an increasingly growing interest in Real-Time object              technologies in both the research community and the industry. The              goal of the workshop is to gather researchers working on real-time              and embedded Java, and related languages, to identify the challenging              problems that still need to be properly solved, and to report on              research results and practical experience. The topics of interest              are not limited to particular variants of real-time Java, we are              looking for novel ideas and techniques in the following research              areas: </p>             <ul>               <li>New real-time programming paradigms and language features </li>               <li>Industrial experience and practitioner reports</li>               <li>Real-time design patterns and programming idioms</li>               <li>Formal models of real-time computation</li>               <li>Extensions to RTSJ and RTCore </li>               <li>Virtual machines and execution environments</li>              <li>Memory management and Real-time Garbage collection</li>               <li>Compiler analysis and implementation techniques</li>               <li>Distributed real-time Java</li>               <li>Scheduling frameworks, feasibility analysis, and timing analysis</li>             </ul>             <div class="titlebar">::Important dates::</div>             <p> <strong>Submissions due</strong>: August 22, 2005<br>               <strong>Notification</strong>: September 19, 2005 </p>             </ul>             <div class="titlebar">::Paper submission::</div>             <p> <strong>Papers must be submitted by email to jv@cs.purdue.edu</strong> in              Postscript or PDF format.

The conference              web page will make available all slides from presentations given              by the attendees, but the conference web page will not host papers.              This is to ensure that the workshop is correctly understood to              be an informal workshop, and that presentation of research at the              workshop is not considered a barrier to republication of that research              in conferences. Papers should be clearly labeled as either:</p>            <ol>              <li>Research papers: These papers present new results which have                not appeared and are not under submission elsewhere. These papers                should not exceed 10 pages in ACM double column format. </li>              <li>Position/Experience papers: Short papers (&lt;5 pages in ACM format)                which present current research or experience using real-time                Java.
